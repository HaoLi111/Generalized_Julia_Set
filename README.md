# Generalized_Julia_Set
Code to visually explore Generalized J Set with Escape-time algorithm iterating z&lt;-z^p+c where p and c are parameters.

The images can be classified w.r.t. Re and Im values of c or Magnitute and Angle of c.
Animations are made, and they are to be uploaded.

For what is meant by J-Set, see wikipedia "Julia Set".

A more technical intro can be found at

## Symmerticality?

From web search (I haven't read technical prove of which) a pair of G. J sets are symmetrical about the Real axis if values for p are equal and values for c are symmertrical about the real axis on the complex plane.
